Interfaces
----------

LASIF defines a project via its directory structure. LASIF currently only
supports one interface to interact with. That is directly through the
command line interface. LASIF used to have a web interface but that is
currently not supported. The web interface is a potential feature that
might be added in the future.


Command Line Interface
======================

The way to interact with LASIF is through the command line interface. Please
read the introduction to the :doc:`../cli` before proceeding.
