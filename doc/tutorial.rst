Tutorial
========

This tutorial will teach you how to perform an iterative full waveform
inversion with LASIF and SES3D on a simple toy example.


.. caution::

    This tutorial is written by hand and thus might not always be completely
    up to date. If, for example, there are slight necessary deviations to the
    arguments of a command, please refer to the command's documentation.

    The rest of LASIF's documentation is generated from the actual code and
    thus is guaranteed to accurately reflect the code base.
