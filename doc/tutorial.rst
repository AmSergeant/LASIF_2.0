Tutorial
========

This tutorial will teach you how to perform an iterative full waveform
inversion with LASIF and SES3D on a simple toy example.
Before going through the tutorial we recommend that you make a mesh which
you can see how is done here: :doc:`meshing`


.. caution::

    This tutorial is written for an older version of LASIF and is thus not
    up to date. It will be properly updated once LASIF's dependencies are
    stable enough.

    The rest of LASIF's documentation is generated from the actual code and
    thus is guaranteed to accurately reflect the code base.
